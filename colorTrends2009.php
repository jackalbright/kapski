<h3>Paint Your House With Refreshing Colors</h3>

<p>You are planning to paint your house and don't understand color trends. You can't help but notice that color is more important to the homeowner than ever. Browse through some of the most popular home-furnishings stores. You'll most likely find up to date color charts and books from the leading paint manufacturers to help customers coordinate colors and furnishings.</p>

<h2>Paint manufactures depend on precise color forecasting to influence your decision to paint.</h2>

<p>Manufacturers spend tremendous amounts of money studying and interpreting color trends. They can't afford to get the colors wrong during a trend shift; it will mean a tremendous short fall in sales to their competitors whose color palettes exhibit the shift in color trends. Not only will the paint manufactures suffer the loss of direct sales to the homeowner planning on house painting but they will lose a lot of sales to the painting contractor looking to make their consumers happy. Getting their color palettes right is vital.
Top paint manufactures are introducing similar color lines.
</p>
<p>Because of my trade, I am exposed to the latest color palettes and the new trends in color they represent. Undeniably, there has been a change in the colors that are in demand. If you put side by side the color forecast of Rohm & Hass Paint quality institute with the color palettes of Benjamin Moore, Pittsburgh Paints, and Sherwin Williams you will find there are a lot of similarities in the colors presented. An international association of design professionals called The Color Marketing Group, who are accountable for keeping their finger on the pulse of color trends, forecast that in the spring of 2009, consumers will be moving to pinks with a bluish tinge, earthier greens, and the bright yellows, turquoises, magentas and the brightest whites.</p>
<h2>The green movement is having an impact.</h2>

<p>Nearly every collection of colors has been influenced by environmentalism. Some paint companies are christening green as the new neutral tone. Eco friendly colors of hues of fern, palm, sage and pine assorted with clear blues or aqua to give a sense of outdoors. The combining of warm browns with sandy tans to project an eco friendly aura will be all the rage. Another example of the trend is a Benjamin Moore color called Split Pea. Split Pea is forecasted to be one of their most up to date colors in 09.The director of color marketing for Sherwin Williams says that peoples taste for the color green are shifting to greens with grayer hues. 
Similarly, the "Voice of Color" program of Porter Paints and Pittsburgh Paints features the following very diverse eco palette of colors.

<ul>
<li>Fair-trade warm organic colors</li>
<li>Eco-Techno equilibrium between core colors and neutrals</li>
<li>Bold pink, blue and orange meeting acidic green symbolizing expressions of freedom</li>
<li>Vintage colors featuring a wintry palette of pale, spidery blue to paper-turned-creamy-yellow with age.</li>
<li>Rich, restful colors are going to be popular. Rohm & Hass has a palette of colors called Returning Home that features rich cranberry reds, pumpkin orange, warm browns and deep-toned blues. Similarly Benjamin Moore has a palette of colors called Homey which includes color names such as Cherokee Brick, Gypsy Pink.</li>
</ul>

</p>
Plums and violet colors continue their regal influence, however orange is becoming more muted and a bit more elegant looking.

<h2>Designers and architects lead the way</h2>
<p>Designers and architects are putting more emphasis on cleaner less muddled colors of dark greens, periwinkle, mauve and a medium neutral with clean colors of red, yellow, green, peach and blue. My suggestion as a painting contractor to the trend conscious homeowner is to first find out when the new color charts will be on exhibit in your leading paint stores, and then contrast the colors of 3 or 4 different paint manufactures. A study of these color palettes will give you an idea of imminent color trends.</p>
