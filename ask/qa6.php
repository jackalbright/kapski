 <p>Price Guide For Wallcovering Installations</p>
   <h3> How much does wallpaper cost?</h3>
  <p>  You can shop for wallpaper at Home Depot or Lowe's and get material at $7 or $8 a single roll. You can go to a wallpaper store and see many "mass market" materials in the $15 to $75 per single roll range. And then there are designer type materials where prices climb over $100 per single roll.</p>

   <h3> How expensive is the labor to have wallcovering done?</h3>
 <p>   A very good question. But it's like asking, "How expensive is a house?"--we all know it depends on a lot of things. The following page is designed to give you some idea about what goes into pricing a job. Of course, every job is different and requires that: #1. I see the jobsite, #2. I see the type of material to be installed and, #3. I measure for material, before any price is given. The prices on this page represent recent actual prices of local jobs in 2008.</p>

<p>None of the prices below include removal of old wallpaper, nor do they include the price of wallcovering material. In situations where old paper must be removed I need to examine to see if it was professionally installed. Previous installations by professionals are usually easier to remove since pros generally use good primers.</p>

<p>   Bathrooms and Powder Rooms generally need 4 to 8 single rolls. Most installations require that a wall-protecting primer be applied before the wallcovering is installed. The following is a ballpark figure for a bathroom in the 4 to 8 single roll range. The price includes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>At-home estimate/measurement</li>
    <li>Removal of towel racks, shower rods, and loosening other fixtures if possible</li>
   <li>Priming bath or powder with wall-protecting primer</li>
    <li>Hanging the wallcovering</li>
   <li>Primer and adhesive material costs</li>
</ol>

    <p>The typical price range for a 4 single roll bath to an 8 single roll bath of this type would be from $250 to $450. Since bathroom jobs are the smallest, you can save money if you combine a bath job with a second bath or another room.</p>
   <p>Kitchens in older homes usually need from 8 to 12 single rolls. Kitchens can vary in price because they may have a soffitt (the sheetrock from cabinet to ceiling) which may have to be wrapped with wallcovering. Some kitchens require that the refrigerator be moved.</p>

 <p>   8 single roll to 12 single roll kitchens are common in houses built before the 1970's and those would cost in the range of $475 to $795 including:</p>
    <ol>
  <li>At-home estimate/measurement</li>
    <li>Moving refrigerator</li>
 <li>Wall Priming</li>
   <li>Wallcovering Installation</li>
   <li>Primer and adhesive materials</li>

</ol>
    <p>Larger kitchens and the newer style "kitchen/great room" or "kitchen/mud room" must be price estimated on a job by job basis.</p>
<p>   Bedrooms, Dining Rooms, and Living Rooms are more straightforward since they normally don't have all the built-in fixtures to cut around compared to kitchens and baths.</p>
   <p> A room of this type would need in the range of 14 to 16 single rolls and would likely cost in the range of $725 to $925. This price would include:</p>

   <ol>
<li>At-home estimate/measurement</li>
<li>Move bed and dressers</li>
<li>Wall Priming</li>
<li>Wallcovering Installation</li>
<li>Primer and adhesive materials</li>
</ol>

<p>Hallways come in many varieties. Two story hallways require scaffolding. Extra labor is involved for set up/knock down of the scaffolding as well as the extra labor of installing wallcoverings in a high place. You could try to guess how much it would cost or you could call for a free estimate.</p>

 <p> Certain fixtures in houses increase labor charges. Items like old-fashioned curved archways, large crown moldings, or fixtures that can't be loosened or removed require more time to cut around. Designer papers or British pulp papers may require that walls first must be lined and that can increase the cost of the job substantially since the room must be wallpapered twice. Other designer papers require hand trimming which also substantially increases the cost of the job. Walls that are very rough and cracked will likely need skim coating and other remedial work which also results in an extra charge</p>
