<p><span class="QA">Q</span> Why should I wait until Spring or Summer to paint the interior of my residence or Office?</p>
 
<p><span class="QA">A</span> You will get the best prices and the best painters that the contractor has if you do the work in the Winter. If you specify Low or No-Voc paint then you will usually not have to deal with odor and an allergenic response to the paint itself.</p>
<p>The painting contractor you choose will be working exteriors during the other seasons and will be focused on good weather to accommodate this work. You will have greater schedule flexibility as well, perhaps not having to wait for rainy weather to be fit in the contractors schedule.</p>
<p>But the biggest plus is the painting contractors are slow in the winter, you will certainly get better prices and better attention.</p>
