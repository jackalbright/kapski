<p><span class="QA">Q</span> What's new in the paint industry...and why should I care?</p>
<p><span class="QA">A</span> Well, having just  returned from the 2009 International Builders Conference, a 5 day exhibition of the latest and newest in residential and commercial building products, I can report the following:
</p>
<p>Sto-guard: A coating that takes the place of Tyvek house wrap. This is a liquid coating the provides a high-performance wind and water barrier that is applied to the exterior of the house or building as it is being constructed, repaired or remodeled. Zero mold growth, substantial energy savings, is permeable and non-flammable. It is also zero VOC! We can apply this coating for less then conventional wrap and it out performs sheet wrap by a mile!   </p>
<p>How about a coating applied to the ceiling of your unfinished attic, office building of commercial space  that will cut cooling costs significantly! A low cost low VOC paint-like product that will save money on cooling costs and is inexpensive to buy and apply!</p>
<p>Or, a low cost paint that when applied to the roof of your building can substantially lower heating and cooling costs.</p>
