<p><span class="QA">Q</span> We want to remodel our newly purchased home.  What are our options for switching from papered to painted walls?</p>
<p><span class="QA">A</span> There are several options as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Drywall over it with 1/4 inch drywall.</li>
<li>Score the paper and then using chemicals to dissolve the glue.</li>
<li>Leave it in place and simply paint over it.</li>
</ul>
<p>For simplicity you may choose to leave it up and paint over it. However, before doing so, it needs quite a bit of prep work. Although the prep work is a bit extensive I feel that this is still far more efficient then installing new drywall or removing and prepping the wall under the removed wall paper for new paint. </p>

<p>The first thing is we take a small 1.5 to 2 inch wide putty knife and lift up and remove any loose paper on the wall along the seams, ceiling and trim. We make sure that we keep peeling it until we reach a point where it won't keep peeling. In some spots we end up removing a 2 x 2 foot square of material. After we are confident that we got all of the loose paper we go back and lightly sand those areas with 120 grit sand paper. 
</p>
<p>The next and most important step is to then dust and prime those areas with a good primer. We use an alkyd primer (Problock) from Sherwin Williams. After the primer is cured (24 hrs) we use all purpose joint compound to smooth out the areas along the seams, ceiling and trim where we have removed the wall paper. This will take 2 skim coats due the shrinkage associated with the compound used. After a slight sanding we wash down the walls and then prime the room with the same primer used over the torn areas. This will prevent the paper from lifting up and any bleed through from the wall paper design itself. After these steps we can go ahead and paint your walls and no one will ever know you had wall paper. For the fussy homeowner the possibility of seeing the seams may rule out this option although skimming over them may be an option.</p>
 
<p>Removing the paper is more difficult and time consuming, especially if the walls weren't sized prior to the installation of the existing wallcovering. If the walls were sized the professional remover will score the paper with a paper tiger and then use a special solution either prepackaged or, like us, one that he has found that works better. The paper and adhesive need to be removed to allow the primer to properly bond. Occasional gouges in the wall will have resulted from the removal which we will patch and sand. Then apply the bonding primer, the first and finish coats of paint and clean up the area. This may be the best bet providing the paper comes off reasonably quickly.</p>
 
<p>Installation of 1/4 inch drywall over the area in question is done when the ceilings and walls are in poor condition as well as when the existing paper will not come off within a reasonable amount of time. This should be done by a capable installer that can join and tape as well as apply three coats of drywall compound and produce a smooth and tight finish. This is a great way to ensure many years of decorating! This method would be the most costly remedy.</p>
