<p><span class="QA">Q</span> I have mold issues but don't want to use bleach. Are there green alternatives?</p>
<p><span class="QA">A</span> Last month you teased us about a new mold and mildew remover that is safe, well, how about it?
So,at the International Builder Convention in January the Concrobium company had a booth that featured a product called Mold Control.</p>
 
<p>I hung around posing as a consumer (not a contractor) and asked a lot of na&iuml;ve questions and got some interesting answers such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bleach is a dangerous product, how can this stuff work if it is so safe and non toxic?</li>
<li>'This stuff is so benign that I can lick it off my fingers!'</li>
</ul>
 
<p>And then he dipped a finger into the container and licked it, then he put it into his mouth and sucked on his finger!
 Needless to say I was surprised. So he got my attention. I read the literature and found it has many uses, some of which I show right here. (Insert a link with the sheets emailed).
 </p>
<p>I would prefer not to use bleach for obvious reasons. I have used Concrobium and it works. Maybe you should give it a try, give Ma Nature a break, give a break to your health and you family's health, too! </p>
