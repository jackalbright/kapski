 <p><span class="QA">Q</span> Last month's Q&A about wallpapering costs was great! What can you tell us about interior paint pricing?</p>
<p ><span class="QA">A</span> Here are some guidelines for interior paint pricing:</p>
     <h3>Interior Paint Pricing</h3>
          <p>A can of fresh paint can take a room from looking dreary and dated to a sense of sparkling newness for a relatively low price compared to other remodeling projects.</p>

<h4> Typical costs:</h4>
<ol>
<li>a.. Interior paint itself costs anywhere from $12-$50 or more a gallon, depending on the quality. Painting a 12x12-foot room, both walls and ceiling, can require $25-$100 worth of paint, plus $10-$50 for primer, brushes, rollers, drop clothes and other supplies. For a 1,500-square-foot home, supplies run $200-$300 for average paint, and $400-$600 for higher quality.</li>
<li>b.. Expect to pay $200-$400 to have a 12x12-foot room painted by a licensed contractor with brand-name paints; a 15x20-foot room or larger runs $300-$700 or more; and a 1,200-1,500 square foot home is $1,100-$2,000 or more. Having the ceiling painted bumps the cost to the high end of the scale.</li>
</ol>
<h4>What should be included:</h4>
<ol>
<li>
a.. Whether doing it yourself or hiring someone, buy the best quality paint you can afford; it lasts longer and in some situations requires only one coat of paint instead of two. Painting a room usually involves prep work, primer and latex or alkyd paints with a range of finishes.</li>
<li>b..  A painting contractor's estimate usually includes all prep work (including taping and moving small items, primer and two or more coats of paint.</li>
</ol>
<h4> Equipment</h4>
<ol>
<li>a.. Cheap paint roller covers leave fuzz on the wall while inexpensive brushes leave streaky marks; pay a few extra cents or dollars to get better results.</li>
<li>b.. It takes more coats of paint and costs more to cover a dark color with a light one, or vice versa.</li>
<li>c.. Removing heavy furniture is often not included in painters' estimates; if you can't do it yourself or hire someone, ask if there will be an extra charge.</li>
<li>d.. Having to paint crown molding, baseboards, wainscoting or other detailed can add to a contractor's estimated price, as can walls taller than the average of 8 feet. The exact extra expense will varies depending on the amount of extra labor required.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Discounts:</h4>
<ol>
<li> a.. If a painter is setting up to do a single room in a home, additional rooms may cost less than the first--it's possible to save money overall by painting everything at once.</li>
<li> b.. Painters' quotes can be lower in winter, early spring or late fall--the off-season--than in peak summer months when there's lot of work available. Ask if there's a discount if the project is done on a fill-in basis, in-between other projects.</li>
</ol>
