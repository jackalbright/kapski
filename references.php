Thank you for your email. I did inspect the follow up work performed at the Jefferson street apartment. <br>
Your workers did a great job of repairing the wall and the apartment is now able to be shown to new prospects.<br>

Thank you for your attention to this issue  and for resolving it in a quick and professional matter.<br>

Looking forward to working with your company in the future.<br><br>

What the customer would like improved: That they could paint my whole house tomorrow!!<br>
Additional Comments: Matt, Elvis, Gene and Alex are just great.
Very courteous nice and professional,
And very hard workers! I don't think they even stopped to go to the bathroom!!!! They did not do a lot of talking or fooling around, those guys just painted!!  They kept checking their work and kept painting. Matt came back this morning and did the touch up issues and apologized for the touch ups, you guys are toooooooooo nice! Steve those guys  are very nice, professional and complete gentlemen.  And very great workers. They get an A+

<p>The painters were professional and cleaned up after themselves each day of the 5 day job.  The owner was responsive to my questions and the job was completed in a timely manner.  the price was agreed upon before work started, and importantly, there were no hidden costs.  I requested additional work be done on the last day of the job and although inconvenient for the painters they were able to complete the extra work.  It was much appreciated.  <br /><br />

<p>Thanks for checking the cubbies yesterday.  I want you to know that Mo and I value the expertise and professionalism that you and the crew brought to our project.

We tell everyone of our experience with you guys and look forward to working with you again when we finish our guest room bathroom in the new year.<br /><br />

<p>The painting job was great! The house looks so crisp and neat outside, and I am delighted with the new color in the master bedroom. Thanks for being so flexible on that add on job. I was impressed with how the plants suffered only a minimum of disturbance. You can use us as a reference!<br /><br />

<p> Once Steve and the crew were finished painting the interior of our new 100 year old apartment, it truly felt like our home.
We are planning a move, a wedding and a marriage. Steve provided wonderful guidance, gentle direction, genuine interest in us and constant encouragement (about things paint and non-paint related!) as my fiance requested the ceiling in our bedroom be painted black. It is "mariner" blue and it is absolutely beautiful as promised!</p>
<p>Steve was always in touch - a perfect example of hands on service with the convenience of technology when needed.
He promptly responded to a concern about some damage an electrician did after the project was finished and, while he was at the house, accepted the delivery of our headboard and footboard, carried it upstairs to the third floor and let me know right away that it had arrived.
Ed and I loved working with Steve and we are looking forward to more projects that will require his thoughtful approach and attention to detail.</p>

<p>I love this crew.  The work is done on time and there is no evidence they were even there -- aside from the beautiful work they do.</p>

<p>What a great job your crew did in my house. It was so easy to work with you, because you listened! I am delighted with the painting of the entire first floor. The boys arrived on time, did their work with skill and accuracy (I am a fussy) and cleaned up at the end of every day ... a big plus in my book. Your crew, your work and the cost were excellent. I am very pleased and I have a few more projects for you. Thank you for an excellent job!</p>
