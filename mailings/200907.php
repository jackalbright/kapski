<h1>Ask Steve</h1>
<p><span class="QA">Q</span> Can you give me a price over the phone on wallpapering my Kitchen?</p>
<p ><span class="QA">A</span>This is a guide that will help walk you through the process:</p>
 <p>Price Guide For Wallcovering Installations</p>
   <h3> How much does wallpaper cost?</h3>
  <p>  You can shop for wallpaper at Home Depot or Lowe's and get material at $7 or $8 a single roll. You can go to a wallpaper store and see many "mass market" materials in the $15 to $75 per single roll range. And then there are designer type materials where prices climb over $100 per single roll.</p>

   <h3> How expensive is the labor to have wallcovering done?</h3>
 <p>   A very good question. But it's like asking, "How expensive is a house?"--we all know it depends on a lot of things. The following page is designed to give you some idea about what goes into pricing a job. Of course, every job is different and requires that: #1. I see the jobsite, #2. I see the type of material to be installed and, #3. I measure for material, before any price is given. The prices on this page represent recent actual prices of local jobs in 2008.</p>

<p>None of the prices below include removal of old wallpaper, nor do they include the price of wallcovering material. In situations where old paper must be removed I need to examine to see if it was professionally installed. Previous installations by professionals are usually easier to remove since pros generally use good primers.</p>

<p>   Bathrooms and Powder Rooms generally need 4 to 8 single rolls. Most installations require that a wall-protecting primer be applied before the wallcovering is installed. The following is a ballpark figure for a bathroom in the 4 to 8 single roll range. The price includes:</p>

<ol>
<li>At-home estimate/measurement</li>
<li>Removal of towel racks, shower rods, and loosening other fixtures if possible</li>
<li>Priming bath or powder with wall-protecting primer</li>
<li>Hanging the wallcovering</li>
<li>Primer and adhesive material costs</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="storyBoxHeading">DIY Tip of the Month</h3>
<p>For a water based, biodegradable non-toxic cleaner in our shop we go to Krud Kutter. This is a fail-safe way to go for the toughest cleaning solution around. We had trouble on pressure washing jobs when factory painted white gutters wouldn't come clean with the washer. We tried Krud Kutter spray and with just a spritz from a spray bottle and a wipe with a clean cloth ...BINGO! Give it a try.</p>
</div>

<div class="storyBox">
<h3 class="storyBoxHeading">More Satisfied Customers!</h3>
<p>&quot;Once again you came to my rescue!  A true knight in shining armor.  The bathroom looks great, thank you so much.  I'm sorry you didn't see it before Ari gutted it.  We decided it was one of the worst bathrooms in Swarthmore.  At one point there were mushrooms growing out of the tile...bet you've never seen that before</p>

<p>Again, thanks, great job.  The project isn't close to being finished, so I may be calling again.</p>

<p>Best Regards,
Janet - Swarthmore, PA!&quot;</p>

<p><span class="QA">Q</span> Are there Eco-Friendly paint colors that aren't  boring?</p>
<p ><span class="QA">A</span>Plenty of them. Eco-Friendly coatings don't have to be boring. </p>

<p>There aren't many choices for green coatings and many manufacturers have the same old boring colors! They don't seem have made the leap regarding the new technologies. So what are your options?</p>

<p>Check out the Sierra Greenhome site at <a href="http://www.sierragreenhome.com">www.sierragreenhome.com</a>. Kapski Painting is a charter member of this great organization and we want to help spread the word.</p>

<p>We have learned a lot about some of the new colors and certifying systems so that you can be sure that the paint you are putting in your home is safe, long lasting and beautiful.</p>
