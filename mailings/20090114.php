<h1>Ask Steve</h1>

<p><span class="QA">Q</span> Do you paint outside in the winter?</p>


<p><span class="QA">A</span> The weather is too cold most days. If there is a spell of warm weather (above 40 degrees during the daytime) and a new door, window or some replaced trim is in need of a primer to keep the wood preserved, this work can and should be done.</p>
<p>Caulking, replacing broken or missing glazing compound in the window sashes to keep water away from the wood and other wood protection jobs can and should be done. Usually the time from the end of November until the first week of March is reserved for interior work.</p>
<p>It is a good idea for those who wish to have exterior painting done in the Spring or Summer to contact their Painting Professional during the off season. This allows the consumer sufficient lead time to compile the proposals, do homework on colors and manufacturers products and, since it is off-season, your Painting Professional will want to sharpen his (or her) pencil and be more competitive than if he had 10 jobs already in line.</p>

<h1>The Promise of Green Paint</h1>
<p>When it comes to building, renovating and maintaining a home, paint is a little like milk: it's a staple, a basic ingredient. And much like milk, a product that helped make the organic food movement a mass-market phenomenon, paint is leading the expansion of the green building movement, as stricter regulations, pressure from environmental groups and increasing consumer demand for eco-friendly products force manufacturers to produce paints with fewer dangerous and smog-producing compounds.</p>


<p>In the last few years, the marketplace for paint has undergone a dizzying revolution, with paint companies furiously researching technologies that will help them compete with new green lines in this changed universe. A number of start-ups, too, have introduced paint brands (several made with milk) that they claim are not only safer for humans and the earth than conventional paint, but more durable and better performing than the paints billed as eco-friendly that came on the market in the early 1990s and failed to take hold.</p>
<p>Not everyone is happy about the shift. Many designers, painters and consumers who applaud environmental responsibility are nevertheless worried about the growing restrictions on oil-based paints (which contain high levels of harmful volatile organic compounds), and even on less hazardous water-based latex ones.</p>
