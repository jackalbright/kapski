<h1>Ask Steve</h1>

<p><span class="QA">Q</span> We want to remodel our newly purchased home.  What are our options for switching from papered to painted walls?</p>
<p><span class="QA">A</span> There are several options as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Leave it in place and simply paint over it.</li>
<li>Score the paper and then, using solvents, remove it along with the adhesive.</li>
<li>Drywall over it if the walls are in bad shape.</li>
</ul>
<p>For simplicity you may choose to leave it up and paint over it. However, before doing so, it needs quite a bit of prep work. Although the prep work is a bit extensive I feel that this is still far more efficient then installing new drywall or removing and prepping the wall under the removed wall paper for new paint. </p>

<p>The first thing is we take a small 1.5 to 2 inch wide putty knife and lift up and remove any loose paper on the wall along the seams, ceiling and trim. We make sure that we keep peeling it until we reach a point where it won't keep peeling. In some spots we end up removing a 2 x 2 foot square of material. After we are confident that we got all of the loose paper we go back and lightly sand those areas with 120 grit sand paper.

<p><span class="QA">Q</span>Last month you teased us about a new mold and mildew remover that is safe, well, how about it?</p>
<p <span class="QA">A</span>>So, at the International Builder Convention in January the Concrobium company had a booth that featured a product called Mold Control.

I hung around posing as a consumer (not a contractor) and asked a lot of na&iuml;ve questions and got some interesting answers such as: ...<a href="http://kapskipainting.com/contact.php">Read More</a> </p>

<h2>Lets Explore 2009 Color Trends</h2>
<h3>Paint Your House With Refreshing Colors</h3>

<p>You are planning to paint your house and don't understand color trends. You can't help but notice that color is more important to the homeowner than ever. Browse through some of the most popular home-furnishings stores. You'll most likely find up to date color charts and books from the leading paint manufacturers to help customers coordinate colors and furnishings.</p>

<h2>Paint manufactures depend on precise color forecasting to influence your decision to paint.</h2>

<p>Manufacturers spend tremendous amounts of money studying and interpreting color trends. They can't afford to get the colors wrong during a trend shift; it will mean a tremendous short fall in sales to their competitors whose color palettes exhibit the shift in color trends. Not only will the paint manufactures suffer the loss of direct sales to the homeowner planning on house painting but they will lose a lot of sales to the painting contractor looking to make their consumers happy. Getting their color palettes right is vital.
Top paint manufactures are introducing similar color lines.

<h2>Spring Cleaning</h2>
<h3>Lets get a jump on spring-cleaning this year by focusing on these
8 essentials:</h3>

<p>Are you ready to give your home a top-to-bottom buffing? Start by focusing your efforts on the big pieces and on the places that make the most difference to you: furnishings, appliances, and carpeting. Once you've covered these major tasks, you'll have your home spring-cleaned in no time.</p>

<p>1. Make doormats welcoming. Shake them, wash them and swat them with a broom. Give them the toughest cleaning they can take. They're your front line against tracked-in dirt -- so keep them clean enough to function at peak efficiency. </p>

<p>2. Clean carpets and upholstery. Fabrics that have absorbed a winter's worth of dirt, body oil, and germs will need a deep cleaning to get them ready for another year of wear -- and for that close inspection by your relaxing guests. </p>
