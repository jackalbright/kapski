<p><span class="QA">Q</span> Last month's Q&A about wallpapering costs was great! What can you tell us about interior paint pricing?</p>
<p ><span class="QA">A</span> Here are some guidelines for interior paint pricing:</p>
     <h3>Interior Paint Pricing</h3>
          <p>A can of fresh paint can take a room from looking dreary and dated to a sense of sparkling newness for a relatively low price compared to other remodeling projects.</p>

<h4> Typical costs:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Interior paint itself costs anywhere from $12-$50 or more a gallon, depending on the quality. Painting a 12x12-foot room, both walls and ceiling, can require $25-$100 worth of paint, plus $10-$50 for primer, brushes, rollers, drop clothes and other supplies. For a 1,500-square-foot home, supplies run $200-$300 for average paint, and $400-$600 for higher quality.</li>
<li>Expect to pay $200-$400 to have a 12x12-foot room painted by a licensed contractor with brand-name paints; a 15x20-foot room or larger runs $300-$700 or more; and a 1,200-1,500 square foot home is $1,100-$2,000 or more. Having the ceiling painted bumps the cost to the high end of the scale.</li>
</ol>

<h1  class="heySteve">Hey Steve!</h1>
<p>One more question this month, this one from Jack A in Kennett Square, PA, who asks:</p>
<p><span class="QA">Q</span> How can I improve my hole drilling technique, seems like I have a knack for splintering the wood and getting less than straight holes?</p>

<div class="signature">
<p>Thanks,<br />
Jack Albright - Kennett Square, PA</p>
</div>

<p><span class="QA">A</span>When I need to bore an especially clean hole, such as one for a screw plug, I typically apply the simple principle of opening up my wallet - I use pricey, precision-machined brad-point drills that I normally can count on for crisp work.
But with certain woods, such as mahogany, even the sharpest cutters leave an unsightly frayed edge. And while up-shear geometry is great for evacuating shavings, it can drag debris past the surface fiber, causing splintering.</p>

<h3>Here's what I do to avoid the problem:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Start the hole with the driver/drill running in reverse to produce down-shear cutting. This pushes the waste wood away from the face of the work piece while compressing surface fibers at the circumference of the hole.
</li>
<li>Finish boring with the driver/drill rotating normally.
</li>
<li>Unless you use a drill press, the hole will likely be 1/64-inch or so out of round.
</li>
<li>In all but the fussiest of circumstances, this amount will be negligible.
</li></ol>
<p>If this method is new to you, try the technique on a few pieces of scrap to get a feel for it.

<p>Your crew was EXCELLENT -- they were professional, hard working and delivered results EARLY.  The final walk-thru was a pleasure and they were happy to work towards perfection.  It was easy and enjoyable to work with them all.  Thank you for the quality work and the great experience.</p>

<h3 class="storyBoxHeading">Is the Next Big Thing Really Smaller Houses?</h3>


<p>The median size of new single-family houses sold in the U.S. has increased 42% during the past 20 years - from 1,650 square feet in 1978 to 2,335 square feet in 2007.</p>

<p>But a closer look at the data shows that this trend has not held steady throughout from year to year. Decreases occurred in 1981-1982, 1995, 2003 and 2007-2008, and I expect house sizes to decrease even further this year and next while the economy remains sluggish. In addition, with the $8,000 first-time home buyer federal tax credit stimulus bringing more first-time home buyers to the market, the trend toward smaller houses will probably continue.
</p>
<p>So, does this mean that every builder should begin building 1,600-square-foot houses?

<h3 class="storyBoxHeading">Corrugated Stainless Steel Tubing: Fire hazard in new homes? </h3>

<p>CSST is thin - about .2 mm, or the thickness of two sheets of paper, com pared with 4 mm for black pipe. Lightning surging through improperly grounded and bonded CSST can arc, puncture a hole in the line, ignite the gas inside and cause a fire.</p>

<p>Seventeen percent of contractors surveyed by Angie's List say they do not ground and bond all CSST; 22 percent say no one is educating them about the product. Manufacturers require training before a contractor can buy CSST, but Tim Scanlan, general counsel with one of the largest CSST makers, Omega Flex, said the certificate doesn't prove the person is qualified to install CSST. It only indicates they've been trained. "The jurisdictions, the local municipalities and the states are going to require that people have certain credentials to perform that work," he says. "It's not the manufacturer's job to make sure the person buying the product and putting it in knows what he's doing. Ultimately, someone has to enforce those rules and the states have those rules. We can't do it. The state does because they look at every installation."</p>
