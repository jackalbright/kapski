<p><span class="QA">Q</span>Hey Steve! Any advice on Real Estate Appraisals?</p>
<p ><span class="QA">A</span>There are new rules that you need to watch out for</p>

<h3>Real Estate Appraisals</h3>

<p>New rules make it impossible to correct an appraisal before it is published and it ruins the deal. The pendulum has swung far too far.</p>

<p>I recently had heard of an appraisal for a custom home where the lot was valued at less than 50% of 12 very recent sales in the same subdivision. There were no short sales, no foreclosures, nothing bad - just an appraiser not doing his job and being overly conservative. (The sale price was in the mid-$60s for two acres and the appraisal was in the $30s.) He had already sold the lot and his customer had lot financing from a local bank based on a good local appraisal. He had an 80% lot loan of about $50,000.</p>

<h3 class="storyBoxHeading">More Satisfied Customers!</h3>

<p>Hi Steve,<br /> 
I just got your thank you card.  Actually, I need to thank <i>you</i>.  When an Oliver person was over here doing some training, I showed him the great job your group did on our ceilings.  He could just not believe it.  It is impossible to find the repairs.  Everyone thinks the ceiling was repainted, but I don't think you did because the paint was perfectly matched.</p>

<h3 class="storyBoxHeading">A Handy Tip</h3>

<p>For many years, I have worn leather gloves to work around the house and sometimes on the job and have found that the inexpensive, stiff gloves I used lasted just as long as the more expensive, soft and pliable ones.
Rather than spend more money for gloves, I have found a simple way to make the less expensive ones fit me more comfortably - while also helping heal my rough hands.</p>

<p>Here's my solution:</p>

<ol>
<li>Coat your hands with a liberal amount of the thickest hand cream you can find, then slip on the gloves and go about your work like you normally would when wearing gloves.</li>


<li>While you are working, the cream soaks into the leather, softens it and forms the gloves to your hands.</li>


<li>In a matter of minutes, the old, stiff gloves will become pliable and you won't be able to tell the inexpensive gloves from expensive ones.</li>
</ol>

<p>By the way, the lotion also helps keeps gloves that have gotten wet from becoming stiff when they dry out. The lotion also seems to make the gloves last a little longer.</p>

<h3 class="storyBoxHeading">Surviving Home Renovations</h3>

<p>In his years of working in design, Nate says he has seen stress levels mount and relationships torn apart when people take on home renovations. "There are very few people I have ever met in my life that have had a successful renovation," he says. "They are happy now, but the process-you always look back and there are a million things they say they wish they could avoid." Nate talks with author Laura Meyer about her book, Remodel This! A Woman's Guide to Planning and Surviving the Madness of a Home Renovation about keeping your budget and marriage intact while remodeling your home.</p>

<p>Laura says she wrote Remodel This!-along with friend Robyn Roth-after surviving a two-year home renovation project. "I think that a woman reading the book will [learn] everything she needs to know going into this process, so that she will be in the driver's seat and stay there during the duration," Laura says.</p>

<p>Laura shares tips she says every women should take to heart before she starts a home renovation project:
