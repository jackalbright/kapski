<p><span class="QA">Q</span> Do you guys just do the whole job? We want to do some of the work ourselves, Are there any groundrules or limitations?</p>
<p ><span class="QA">A</span>We work well with others. It is not uncommon these days to find the dollar stretched so this is understandable. Here are a few suggestions:</p>

      
   <p> A Few First Steps for Do-It-Yourselfers:</p>
          <p>Take a moment to consider a few important preliminary steps. Home improvements can be like a Chinese puzzle in complexity, with interlocking parts that must proceed in exactly the right direction and order or it simply doesn't work. Planning is key. It's critically important to be clear about your goals and to develop a plan for achieving them.
</p>
          <p>Whether you're adding a room, building a deck, or installing new cabinets, spending a little extra time planning before you actually launch your project can make the process much smoother, and your results far more successful.</p>

        <p>  Here are seven steps that are key to proper planning:</p>
<ol>

         <li>List your priorities.<br />
          Break down the various elements of your plans and rate the importance of each. Most people want fast, inexpensive, high quality results. As a rule, you can pick two of these. If you want it fast and inexpensive, chances are pretty good that it won't be high quality. If you want it fast and high quality, chances are it won't be inexpensive.</li>

         <li>Estimate cost.<br />
          Nothing is worse than halting progress halfway through a project for lack of funds. To accurately anticipate costs, you'll have to do some homework. Begin by visiting a home center to find out what the materials and fixtures will cost. In addition, it's a good idea to get three bids for the work from contractors or other professionals, even if you plan to do some or all of your own work. Getting bids can give you a feel for what the work will involve and help you determine the potential savings of doing it yourself. In some cases, looking at the numbers may convince you it's wiser to hire a professional. Kapski Painting can help here!</li>

          <li>Plan for help you'll need.<br />

<h1 class="askSteve">Did You Know?</h1>
<p> The heating unit went out on my dryer. Our repairman  told us that he wanted to show us something, and he went over to the dryer and pulled out the lint filter. It was clean. (We always clean the lint from the filter after every load.) He took the filter over to the sink and ran hot water over it. The lint filter is made of a mesh material. I'm sure you know what your dryer's lint filter looks like. Well, the hot water just sat on top of the mesh! It didn't go through it at all!</p> 
<p>He told us that dryer sheets cause a film to form over the mesh, and that's what burns out the heating unit. You can't <em>see</em> the film, but it's there. It's the substance that's in the dryer sheets, the purpose of which is to make your clothes soft and static free.</p>
<p>
 The best way to keep your dryer working for a very long time (and to keep your electric bill lower) is to take that filter out and wash it with hot soapy water and an old toothbrush (or other brush) at least every six months. That makes the life of the dryer at least twice as long! How about that? Learn something new everyday! I certainly didn't know dryer sheets would do that, so, I thought I'd share! </p>
<p>Note: I  tested my screen by running water on it. The water ran through a little bit but mostly collected  in the mesh screen. After washing it with warm soapy water and a nylon brush, the water ran right through the screen! That repairman knew what he was talking about! </p>

<h3 class="storyBoxHeading"> Do-It-Yourself Repair Tips</h3>
    
<p>Here are a few helpful tips to keep in mind when you're doing your own repairs to appliances, fixtures, and systems in your home:</p>

<p>Use a digital camera, or make a sketch of how things fit together before you take them apart so that you will know how to reassemble them. As you begin to disassemble a unit, line up all the parts in the exact order in which they were removed. That will keep everything in order and make reassembly easy.</p>

<p>Take the worn or defective parts with you when you go to the hardware store or home improvement center so you can find an exact replacement.</p>

<p>Rubber washers, gaskets, small fittings, and other inexpensive parts that have a limited life should be replaced along with the defective part. Otherwise, you may find yourself disassembling everything for another repair in the near future. When you are replacing something that has several inexpensive parts-such as a sink trap-it oftentimes pays to replace all of the components.</p>
