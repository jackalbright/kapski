<h3>What should I look for in a contractor? </h3>


<h3>How to find a good painting contractor</h3>
<p>Ok, now you have come to the conclusion to hire a painting contractor or at least get a couple of quotes for your painting project. The cost of house painting can be substantial and for a high quality job even more. Get the most out of your paint job by choosing your painter correctly.
</p>
<p>In order to help you find that perfect painter I have put together some ideas. Starting with your personal sources and ending with the internet sources. These on-line referral services offer free price quotes on a variety of construction services.
</p>
<h3>Trusted sources</h3>

<p>The best place to start is with your friends, family and co-workers. 
Therefore, start asking questions; </p>


<h4>Are you happy with the quality provided by the painting contractor? </h4>

<p>Everybody has their own ideas of quality, so you should take a look at their house and judge for yourself. Pay attention to cut-in areas around doors, windows and trim. Are the lines straight and was caulking applied. Interior or exterior doesn't matter; proper surface preparation always leads to better, more pleasing results. </p>


<h4>Did the painting contractor protect non painted surfaces or areas? </h4>

<p>For exteriors this includes concrete, roofing and plantings. For interiors moving and protecting furniture is a major concern but don't forget about the flooring. </p>


<h4>Were they courteous and pleasant? </h4>

<p>This is a very important consideration. The entire experience, from beginning to end, needs to be as stress free as possible. Plus if the house painter enjoys their job, the quality and attention to details will be better. The customers attitude can and will affect the entire paint job. </p>


<h4>Did the painting company start and finish in a timely fashion? </h4>

<p>Arriving at a reasonable time every morning reinforces a schedule. Remember, with an exterior the weather always dictates the schedule.</p> 


<h4>Is a warranty included? </h4>


<p>If a warranty was included find out if it has a reasonable amount of time before expiring, 2 years is enough, and if it has any value. Simply stating a warranty isn't enough. Get it in writing and understand its limitations! </p>

<p>If asking friends, family or co-workers doesn't produce any leads there are other avenues that can help.</p>

<h3>Local Paint Store</h3>

<p>First and foremost is your local paint store, not the home improvement center. Most professional painters purchase their products from a local supplier, a paint store. Here they have built a reputation, either good or bad, based on the quality of products purchased over time and timely payment if a store credit account is used.</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchasing products of the highest quality indicates a true concern for the well being of your home.</li>
<li>If a painting contractor primarily purchases from a single source, for years, a reputation has been built with this supplier.</li>
<li>On time payment is always a good indicator of paint jobs finished and customers that have paid for the service.</li>
</ul>
<p>Talk to the person behind the countertop and ask some questions. Describe your project and ask for any recommendations. Chances are they will know someone that is trustworthy.
</p>
<h3>On Line</h3>

<p>Internet sourcing is becoming more popular every year. These lead generating businesses can help you find painting contractors in your area. The referral company will have checked out each contractor but cannot guarantee the quality or honesty of the paint job.
</p>
<p><p>This is similar to the Better Business Bureau, but each referred lead will cost the painter money (Whether they get the job or not). Only members of the referral network will receive your job description and contact information. Plus, it is unlikely you will actually choose the painters that respond. It is still best to use local sources and recommendations from people you trust.</p></p>

 
<h3>Additional Considerations</h3>
 
<p>The key to finding a good, reputable painting contractor is to ask a lot of questions. Try to narrow down your choices to 3, no need to call 10 painters.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ask for references of jobs that were similar to yours.</li>

<li>Note if the painting contractor was businesslike, courteous, and punctual with the appointment.
</li>
<li>Ask for a comprehensive proposal that includes what will be done and what products used. This includes the type and amount of surface preparation, priming and the type of primer, caulking (type and where used), and the brand of paint used with a reference to the manufactures product line. How many coats of paint will be applied must also be included in the proposal.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully you have a list of qualified painting contractors. Before calling you need to take some notes. Describe, in detail, what you want done. What colors you like, etc. This information will assist the house painter in putting together a complete painting estimate.</p>

<p>It seems that every year more homeowners are choosing to hire a professional painting contractor than do it themselves. A professional painting contractor can offer a level of quality not easily obtained by the average do-it-yourselfer.</p>

<p>Every home is different and will require different amounts and types of preparation as well as different mixes of products to achieve lasting results. The more types of paint jobs that a painter does the more they learn. Only the experience of your house painter can produce lasting results.</p>
