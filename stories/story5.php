<h4>Corrugated Stainless Steel Tubing: Fire hazard in new homes? </h4>

<p>CSST is thin - about .2 mm, or the thickness of two sheets of paper, com pared with 4 mm for black pipe. Lightning surging through improperly grounded and bonded CSST can arc, puncture a hole in the line, ignite the gas inside and cause a fire.</p>

<p>Seventeen percent of contractors surveyed by Angie's List say they do not ground and bond all CSST; 22 percent say no one is educating them about the product. Manufacturers require training before a contractor can buy CSST, but Tim Scanlan, general counsel with one of the largest CSST makers, Omega Flex, said the certificate doesn't prove the person is qualified to install CSST. It only indicates they've been trained. "The jurisdictions, the local municipalities and the states are going to require that people have certain credentials to perform that work," he says. "It's not the manufacturer's job to make sure the person buying the product and putting it in knows what he's doing. Ultimately, someone has to enforce those rules and the states have those rules. We can't do it. The state does because they look at every installation."</p>

<p>But the installation guidelines can vary by state and city. For example, the 2009 National Fuel Gas Code includes more rigorous guidelines for grounding CSST. It will take most local governments a year or more to adopt the 2009 code. Missouri and the District of Columbia are still following the 2000 code and eight other states are still following the 2003 code. Cities in each state can adopt stricter guidelines without state approval.</p>

<p>Compounding matters is that CSST involves aspects of both plumbing and electrical work. The two trades follow different guidelines. Electricians comply with the National Electrical Code, which hasn't updated its grounding guidelines for CSST. "We do what we can to put that [bonding and grounding] requirement out there," Scanlan says. "But it's really a code issue that's the impediment to full compliance with best practices."</p>

<p>That's all the more reason to hire a third-party inspector, Luttrall says. "The municipal guys can't call out anything that is not written down in their building codes. It may not be legally wrong, but it's just poor construction techniques. A good third-party inspector, that's what we do. If it's unsafe, it doesn't make any difference if there's a law. It's unsafe. A fire never read a rule book."

<p>Properly installed CSST, in his view, is no more dangerous than any other building material. "Wood would never be approved as a building material if it was new to the market today," he says. "It rots. It burns. It would never pass muster."</p>

<p>Still, given a choice Luttrall would use black pipe in his own house. "Iron pipe is pretty fool-proof if it's installed correctly to start with," he says. "I've seen iron pipe systems that are 50, 75 years old and are still in pretty good shape. Nobody can say that for CSST because it hasn't been around that long yet."</p>

<p>Jon Guy, chief executive of home builder GuyCo in Avon, Ind., dropped CSST last year in favor of black pipe. Even if CSST is installed properly, he says its flexibility allows subsequent contractors to shift the lines. "Just because you supervised the process in the very beginning doesn't mean it continues to stay that way throughout the longevity of your home ownership," he says. "We absolutely refuse to use it. It's just too dangerous."</p>

<p>Home builder Rex Weiper of Carmel, Ind., disagrees. He uses CSST and says it's a fine product when installed properly. "I've been building houses for 38 years," he says. "If something is not installed properly it will fail. If shingles are not installed properly, your roof is going to leak."</p>

<p>Also, he now uses CounterStrike, a relatively new type of CSST by Omega Flex that has a black coating.</p>
