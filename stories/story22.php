<h3>Homeowners should follow clues to find perfect interior paint color scheme</h3>

<p>Area residents can go to any paint store, and they will find lots of information about color. But, if they want to create an interior paint color scheme that’s just right, they shouldn’t overlook their own personal clues, according to the Paint Quality Institute.</p>

<p>"Most people are naturally drawn to certain colors that they’ll favor time and again," says Debbie Zimmer, paint and color expert for the Paint Quality Institute. "Focusing on colors that dominate one’s wardrobe and furnishings, for example, provides valuable clues to the best tints and shades to use when doing home painting."
</p>
<p>To that end, Zimmer suggests that homeowners start their search for paint color not at the paint store, but closer to home ... in their closet, in fact. If they’re like most people, the majority of their wardrobe will tend to fall into one or two color families. </p>
<p>"If you see lots of blue and green garments, then you obviously are fond of these colors, and very comfortable when clothed in them. That makes it likely you’ll feel very much at home in surroundings painted in these same hues," Zimmer said.

<p>Another clue is the color and character of the car one owns. Those driving a racy red sports car will probably be more attracted to a paint color scheme with bold, bright shades rather than quiet neutral hues. Those who own a white or beige sedan, it may indicate they will be happier with a more understated paint color scheme.
"Doubly important are the clues you discover among furnishings in the rooms you’ll be painting," said Zimmer. "Perhaps a color that appears in a piece of fabric will pique your fancy, or one that embellishes a piece of furniture, or even the color of glaze on a ceramic bowl."</p>

<p>Building upon color clues like these, you’ll soon make a strong case for a particular paint color or colors  and applying them to walls or woodwork will help "pull together" the appearance of the entire space.</p>

<p>If an investigation has helped someone identify the dominant color for a room, but they’re still searching for an overall color "scheme," it’s now time to go to the paint store – if possible, with a sample of the key color (or an object in which it appears). Homeowners can leaf through the literature there until they find a paint palette that includes the desired hue, and see which colors are recommended as companions for it.
Those who are adept at visualizing things, might be able to purchase their paint at this point. But a safer tack is to take color cards home and tape them to walls, woodwork, wherever, and see how the various colors look right where they’ll be applied. They should be viewed in daylight and at night. This will add certainty to the selection.
</p>
<p>If a homeowner is not sure how much of each color to use in a room, they should choose one color to be dominant, and another as the secondary color. If the plan is to employ a three-color paint scheme, then there should be an adherence to the "60-30-10 rule," which will help bring color proportionality to the space. Use the dominant color on roughly 60 percent of the surface, the secondary color on roughly 30 percent, and incorporate the third hue on the remaining 10 percent as a "punch color" or accent.
</p>
<p>No matter which colors are used to enhance a home’s interior, Zimmer recommends that honeowners should work only with top quality 100 percent acrylic latex paint. It produces a durable finish that will resist fading, resulting in color that will remain true year after year.</p>
