<h2>Signs of a Strong Housing Market </h2>
<p class= "attribution">from msn.com</p>

<p>With lower home prices and attractive mortgage rates, 2009 will present plenty of bargains for real-estate shoppers. But as the historic bust continues, Americans everywhere are learning a painful lesson about homebuying: Property values don't always increase. People looking to purchase a home this year should make sure they're buying into a community that can support long-term value. With the help of housing experts, U.S. News &amp; World Report compiled a list of the top ingredients of strong housing markets:</p>

<h3>A well-Groomed Neighborhood </h3>

Well-maintained homes and landscaping have a positive effect on property values in that community, says Joshua Dorkin, founder and CEO of BiggerPockets.com, a real-estate networking and information site. By caring for the appearance of their homes, residents help to create a more aesthetically pleasing environment that future real-estate hunters will want to buy into. So when you're eyeing a home, make sure to take a drive through the entire neighborhood. Take note of how the neighbors care for their homes, lawns and gardens. "Run-down houses and abandoned cars are big red flags," Dorkin says.

<h3>Good Schools</h3>

<p>Given the importance of education, communities located within strong school districts tend to support higher home prices. Parents, after all, will want to move into the communities with the best educational opportunities. "The school district is important in terms of increasing demand for that particular area," says Richard Moody, chief economist at Mission Residential. Would-be homebuyers can determine the strength of a local school system by accessing online information from local governments or community Web sites, Moody says.</p>

<h3>Low Crime </h3>

<p>Low crime rates also support strong home values. Since nobody wants to live in a neighborhood where they feel unsafe, crime limits housing demand in a given community. As a result, it's important to obtain crime statistics for the neighborhood you're considering moving into. The best way to do that, says Steve Dexter, a foreclosure expert and author of the book "Beat the Banks", is to contact the local police department. "The police department is a public utility," Dexter says. "Most medium- to large-sized [communities] have a public information [officer] that is dedicated to interacting with the public." By contacting this office, home shoppers can get their hands on all the information they'll need to determine a community's level

<h3>Close to public transportation</h3>

<p>Proximity to public transportation or commuter rail can also help boost home values, says Ron Phipps, a broker with Phipps Realty in Warwick, R.I. He says Americans are increasingly willing to pay a premium for properties that allow them to be less dependent on cars. "Access to bus lines and commuter rail lines is of huge value," Phipps says. "The price of fuel is going to go up again and a lot of my clients are saying, 'OK, how do we position ourselves to minimize that impact?'"

<h3>Favorable population trends</h3>

<p>It's also important to look at the population trends in the city you're considering moving to, Moody says. "You want to see a track record of steady population growth, which supports growing demand for housing, which will in turn support rising home values," Moody says. Such data can be found online at the U.S. Census Bureau, or through local county or township Web sites, he says.</p>
