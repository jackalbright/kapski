<h3>Building Products - Best Roofing Shingles</h3>
<p>GAF Shingles Top Brand in Builder Magazine Survey of Building Material Users</p>

<p>Builder's Magazine 2010 Brand Use Study earlier this summer found that GAF
Materials Corporation is the top quality-rated brand for asphalt/fiberglass
shingles.</p>

<p>The study was based on a Hanley-Wood sponsored survey of 10,800 builders,
builder-developers and general contractors asking them about brands in 81
product categories.
</p>
<p>GAF-Elk brands were in the top three spots for quality in the
asphalt/fiberglass shingles category. Each line is produced with the
manufacturer's evolving Advanced Protection technology, which has improved
the performance of the shingles, including superior wind resistance, and has
lowered waste.</p>

<h4>The Advanced Protection approach:</h4>

<p>a. Uses a state-of-the-art fiberglass mat technology with automated
processes that eliminate unnecessary filler weight while optimizing the
protective asphalt. This results in a lower-weight shingle with advanced
protection against cracking, tearing and severe winds.</p>


<p>b. Using the lowest profile glass mat in North America as well as
proprietary processes, binders and fiber-strand orientation for optimal
composite performance. Its reduced weight allows a greater percent of
asphalt in the top or weathering layer and greater flexibility for bending
with fewer cross-sectional mat cracking stresses. Its higher fiber density
makes it stronger.</p>


<p>c. The shingles better withstand thermal cracking during severe
temperature swings (150 to zero degrees F) before the shingle cracks. In one
example, GAF-Elk shingles performed 33% better in thermal cracking than a
competitor's heavier shingle.</p>
