<h3>Wooster Makes "Green Painting" Possible Without Green Paint</h3>
 
<p>Wooster, OH</p>
<p>The expression goes, "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle," and the Wooster ECO KitTM is designed to reduce waste, contains reusable products, and is made from recycled materials.</p>
 
<p>This 5-piece kit includes a sturdy metal 1-quart tray and 9-inch cage frame for repeated use.  Also found in this package are a biodegradable tray liner and two 9-inch ECO RollerTM covers.</p>
 
<p>The fabric of the ECO Roller is made from 100% certified recycled plastic PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles.  The fabric is also free from the presence of dyes or chemicals used for coloring.  It is available in 3/8-inch pile, and is recommended for use with flat paints on smooth surfaces like most walls and ceilings.  The ECO Roller is also sold separately in a convenient 2-pack.</p>
 
<p>The ECO Liner&trade; is made from recycled materials, and it is also biodegradable!  The clear plastic contains special additives to make it fully degrade after disposal.  It will become a humus-like biomass in any landfill or compost system within one to five years.*  The form-fitting ECO Liner assists in extending the life of Wooster's R402 Deluxe Metal Tray (included in the kit).  The ECO Liner is also available for purchase individually.</p>
